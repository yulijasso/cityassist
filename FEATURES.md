# CityAssist — Feature Overview

## What is CityAssist?

CityAssist is an AI-powered civic chatbot platform that helps city governments manage resident conversations, route inquiries to the right departments, and track everything through an admin dashboard. Each city (organization) gets their own isolated workspace with full control over their chatbot, departments, knowledge base, and team.

## Authentication & Multi-Tenancy

### Clerk Authentication
- Sign in / Sign up via Clerk with modal-based popups (centered, minimalistic design)
- Organization-based multi-tenancy — each city team operates in their own isolated workspace
- URL-based tenant isolation: `/dashboard/{org-slug}/...`
- All data (conversations, departments, settings) is scoped per organization using localStorage keys

## Login & Account Structure

### Admin-Controlled Account Creation
- Only admins can create accounts — there is no public self-registration
- Admins create and manage all user accounts within their organization

### Invite-Based User Onboarding
- Admins invite users to the application via email invitations
- Invited users receive an email with a link to join the organization
- Upon accepting the invite, users are automatically onboarded into the correct organization workspace
- Users cannot access the platform unless they have been explicitly invited by an admin


### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full access — can invite members, manage organization settings, delete accounts, and see all security options
- **Member**: Dashboard access — can view and manage conversations, knowledge base, and departments, but cannot delete accounts
- Role label (Admin/Member) displayed in the sidebar under the organization switcher
- Security tab (with Delete Account) is completely hidden for members — they can still access their profile to update name, email, etc.

### Auto-Redirect for Invited Users
- When a user is invited and accepts, they are automatically redirected to the dashboard — no manual org selection needed
- Users without an organization see a clean "Waiting for access" screen with a spinner
- The app auto-selects the first organization and redirects seamlessly

## AI Capabilities

### Intent Classification
Every message is classified into one of five intents:
- **Info Request** — Resident wants to know something ("What are the library hours?")
- **Process Guidance** — Resident needs help with a process ("How do I apply for a building permit?")
- **Complaint** — Resident is reporting an issue ("There's a pothole on Main Street")
- **Emergency** — Urgent issue, auto-escalates the ticket ("There's a gas leak at 5th and Oak")
- **Out of Scope** — Not related to city services ("What's the weather tomorrow?")

### Department Routing
The AI automatically routes conversations to the correct department based on configured routing keywords.
